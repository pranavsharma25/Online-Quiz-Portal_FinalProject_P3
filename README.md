The admin user can add questions using the addQuestions API.
The admin user can create a quiz by entering quizid and selecting questions with questionid.
The admin user can obtain statistics on total quizzes, questions, and users by using their APIs.
The admin user can find the users who participated in the quiz along with scores and standings.
Users can explore various quizzes created by the admin.
Users can create their profile using new user registration.
Users can take the quiz and try to answer the questions.

# Admin User Scenario:

The admin wants to create an online quiz for the website users.
The admin creates a set of questions along with their answers.
Admin opens login API and logs in with the admin username and password.
Once admin is authenticated, an access token is generated that can be used to add and modify quizzes, questions, and users.
The admin creates a quiz by providing a name and an id.
For creating a new quiz, the admin user enters a quizid and selects questions from the database using the questionid.
After adding the questions, the admin runs the API and makes the quiz available to its users.
Once the quiz is released, website users can start taking it.

# Participants Scenario:

The user uses the register API to create an account, which provides an access token.
After registering an account, the user logs in with the access token to take any quiz.
The user browses various quizzes created by Admin using the getAllQuizzes API.
The user attempts the quiz using quizid and gives the possible answers.
The user views whether the provided answers are right or wrong. The correct answer is highlighted differently so that they are easily identified.
After completing the quiz, the user checks the scores and compares their standings with other users.
